            These are a few screenshots of game jam games / game projects I have previously worked on (most were done in college). 
            <br><br>
            If you would like to try them out, please contact me for a link. 
            <br>
            The first two games were made with a team of 3-4 people and were finished in ~10-12 hours.
            <br><br>
            The last was part of a demo project for a "wacky racers" style game where you got a procedurally generated group of things and that was your "vehicle". 
            <br><br>
            (I plan to add a few more screenshots / videos soon!)
